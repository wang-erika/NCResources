# NCResources
Website using React, JavaScript 

## Inspiration
After the recent Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v Wade, we wanted to build a place for people to learn more about its significance, gain access to information on available abortion resources, and donate to Planned Parenthood.

## What it does
Our web app provides the location of the 14 abortion clinics in NC sorted by the region they are located in. It also provides a link for users to donate to Planned Parenthood and a brief YouTube video summarizing the history of Roe v Wade.

## How we built it
Neither of us had any experience creating a web app before, so we wanted to use this opportunity to learn new technologies. The website was built using React. We created the different styles of the components using CSS and coded the components using Javascript.

## Challenges we ran into
A few of the coding challenges we ran into was getting the different components to look right. For instance, the menu section was a bit too low so we tried playing around with the dimensions to fix it. Another issue we ran into was that some of the information we found to help with our project was outdated so we needed to find updated information.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Since neither of us had any experience with frontend and website design, we were proud that we were able to create an informational website within 24 hours.

## What we learned
We learned about the basics of frontend engineering using React, such as how different components combine to create the layout of a website.

## What's next for NC Abortion Resources
For the next steps, we'd like to add a feature that asks for the users' location and provides them with info about clinics within a certain mile radius. Another feature we could add is expanding the website to include different states so you could find clinics in all states that offer them.
